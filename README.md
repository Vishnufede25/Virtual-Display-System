# Virtual-Display-System
Build an interface for collaboration, sharing documents, code, webcams, and sketchpad. In a Software Modeling &amp; Analysis final project (Fall 2012) we explored the use of a large display as a medium for collaboration in a Software Development Server Federation. This project implements a prototype for this kind of display system. VDS is an application that drives a large display3 for use in collaboration systems. The purpose of this project is to develop a framework and rendering process to display simultaneously web-cam windows, document windows, drawing surfaces, directory views, and information derived from queries into NoSql Databases or some repository. For this project the displayed resources would be source code text, pdf files, sketch pads, skype windows, all drawn from a local repository. It could be implemented as a browser displaying an HTML5 page that supports adding and removing elements, changing view sizes and locations, and saving a current session in some persistant format like XML.
